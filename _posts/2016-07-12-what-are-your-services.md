# What Are Your Services?
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/96c79bc3-6fd5-4c84-b704-c2f971cd2944.jpg)

As reject boxes are sold below cost, we apologize that we are not able to provide exemplary service to you.

Our cash and carry services only walk-in customers. Unfortunately, 

1. We cannot block any ready stock reject boxes
2. Boxes sold on first-come, first-serve basis
3. Boxes are in as-is condition (please don't be fussy with the condition), sizes are fixed subject to availability of reject cartons
4. We do not do delivery or packing services
