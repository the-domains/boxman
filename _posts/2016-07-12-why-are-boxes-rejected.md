# Why Are Boxes Rejected?

We are a carton box maker company which produces in large quantities. We often have reject boxes due to printing errors and sizing errors by either our manufacturing side or client side. They are equally high in quality for your packing purposes.

They are priced below cost which is your gain and our loss. We hope these boxes can help in your house moving or office moving.
